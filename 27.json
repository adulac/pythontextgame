 "description": "Your eyes adjust to the light as you get closer, almost blinding you when you reach the entrance. Once inside, you look to your left and see a chained prisoner who is signalling to you. You have a mission though, and it is to slay the creature. It is only a couple feet in front of you and it hasn't noticed you yet.",
